# toDoApp
This is to-do app with Python and Django. Here I decided to test my newly acquired skills in Django framework. Here I created models, views, templates and forms. App has basic CRUD functionality.


##How to install

*Make sure you have Python and Django installed in your PC/Laptop
 > You can check if you have Python installed by using the following command. If you dont have Python installed, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  ```
  python --version
  ```
 > You can check if you have Django and pip installed by using the following command.
  ```
  pip --version
  django-admin --version
  ```
 
 > Install pip and Django if you dont have them installed
  ```
  python get-pip.py
  pip install django
  ```
*Install project, open it in VS code, in terminal write
  ```
